# 🔐 Ethereum ECDSA Forge - WIP

**The ultimate Rust implementation of ECDSA for Ethereum - because cryptography shouldn't be cryptic.**

## 🚀 Why Ethereum ECDSA Forge Exists

Other libraries make you choose between security, usability, and Ethereum compatibility. **We don't believe in compromises.**

Existing solutions are:
* 🐌 Difficult to integrate with modern Ethereum features
* 🔓 Casual about security best practices
* 📚 Overly academic with poor documentation
* 🧩 Scattered across multiple dependencies
